*Here are another 3 facts about myself, which 2 are true and 1 is false. Can you guess which one is false (see at the very end)?* :wink:

1. This is my third degree in post-secondary education :books:
2. I was a swimmer at the junior national level back in high school :swimmer:
3. I am married :ring:

**My favourite soccer team is FC Barcelona. They play an attractive offensive style, and never look to sit back to defend. Their games are very entertaining, and a lot of their combinations comes from simple plays any average player can do yet they perfect it and make it look very easy.**

**As mentioned earlier, my favourite vacation destination is Kyoto in Japan. Here are a few cool pictures I took during my trip this summer:**


Gion is a big tourist attraction area, famed for being the [*geisha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geisha) district. The geisha's tend to come out during the night time to their assigned venue where they entertain guests during their meals.

The Kinkakuji Temple's Golden Pavilion - another big tourist attraction.

Like the cheese tarts you see in Vancouver, except matcha flavored!

Another tourist attraction, the [*Arashiyama Bamboo Grove*](https://www.insidekyoto.com/arashiyama-bamboo-grove). This is locatd at Arashiyama, the western outskirts of Kyoto, Japan. Personally my favourite district to visit - very peaceful, quiet, and village-like (away from the tourist-y spots)
